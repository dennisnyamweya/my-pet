<h1>My Pet Website</h1>
<p>My pet is a dog named Patsy.
   Tipsy is an adorable brown dog that has a few black spots spread across his body and tail. Patsy is a kelpie crossed with a border collie, and he has fluffy velvety ears.
   Even though Patsy has a very strong body frame,
   he has a very gentle face and is always a friendly dog to those whom he knows.
    If a stranger approaches out house, however,
    Patsy can get very aggressive. He always barks loudly to attract our attention to the approaching stranger.</p>
    <p>Patsy loves many things. Among these is to nuzzle his wet nose in my hands and in the hands on my parents and siblings.
      He craves attention most of the time because he is scared of being abandoned or ignored.
      I actually came across Patsy while he was still a puppy. It appears his owner had abandoned him on the road. I found him wondering in our neighborhood.
      I informed my parents about the puppy. I wanted to keep him. They communicated with the local authorities so the authorities could allow us to adopt the pet.
